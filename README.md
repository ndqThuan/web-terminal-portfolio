This is a web portfolio built for those who love the good ol' terminal days. 
Made with Alpine.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it's both fun and functional.

Imagine this: Your visitors see a cool terminal interface with a custom prompt. They navigate using commands, just like the real deal. Pretty sweet, right?

## Here's the lowdown:

- Alpine.js keeps things smooth: We use this lightweight JavaScript framework to make the interaction between you and your portfolio seamless.
- Back to basics (but way cooler): This project uses pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a great way to level up your skills with these core web development technologies.
- Looks good on any device: Doesn't matter if they're on a desktop, tablet, or phone, your portfolio will look amazing. Responsive design FTW!

## Make it your own:

This terminal is your playground! Customize the theme, commands, and content to match your style. Let your personality shine through! âœ¨
